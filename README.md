# CIPHER: Cyber Intrusion Prevention and Hazardous Event Responder

## Overview

The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a desktop application designed to monitor and analyze network activity for detecting potential security threats, such as malware or unauthorized access. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify both known and emerging threats. This application is built with **Golang** for the backend and **SvelteKit** for the frontend, providing a seamless, efficient, and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of network traffic and process activities.
- **Threat Detection**: Identifies anomalies and potential threats using machine learning models.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Responsive Frontend**: Built with **SvelteKit**, providing an interactive and dynamic user interface.
- **Efficient Backend**: Powered by **Golang** for handling real-time data and processing efficiently.
- **User Notifications**: Alerts the user about suspicious activities or threats.
- **Detailed Reports**: Generates detailed logs and reports for network administrators.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Golang
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit
- **Machine Learning**: Integrated with pre-trained models for detecting intrusion patterns.
- **Database**: (Optional) SQLite or PostgreSQL for storing logs and user data.
